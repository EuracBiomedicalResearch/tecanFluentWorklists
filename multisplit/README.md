#Multi Split
Here we were splitting one large source tube into several smaller aliquots. The wanted outcome was that 
each smaller aliquot would be of a user setable value with the last aliquot containing the remaining volume
of the source. Added complexity was that the minimum and maximum of the final aliquot had to be within
certain limits as well.

Other features were that a sample tracking list was to be produced keeping track of the
location and the volume of each aliquot and from which source it came.
