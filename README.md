# tecanFluentWorklists
Scripts used for generating worklists for the Tecan Fluent. The Fluent has a liquid level detection 
that is currently unparalelled by any other liquid handling manufacturer as far as I know and have tested.
The following are collections of scripts for generating worklists based on the liquid level that is detected.
The liquid levels detected are saved into text files that form the primary source for these scripts in the
Fluent control software. How to do that is beyond the focus of this repo.

The reason for these scripts is that although the control software is also incredibly easy to use, 
some of the features regarding variable volume dispensing in the software are not obviously ameanable
to the tasks that we have solved here with worklists that then get loaded and executed on the Fluent.
